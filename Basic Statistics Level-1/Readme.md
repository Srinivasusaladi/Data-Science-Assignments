Three Coins are tossed, find the probability that two heads and one tail are 
obtained?
Answer: 
 HHT or HTH or THH
 =1/2*1/2*1/2 (+) 1/2*1/2*1/2 (+) 1/2*1/2*1/2
 = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8
 = 3/8
 
Two Dice are rolled, find the probability that sum is
a) Equal to 1
b) Less than or equal to 4
c) Sum is divisible by 2 and 3
Answer:
a) Equal to 1
Probability = 0
b) Less than or equal to 4
= (1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(2,1)(2,2)(3,1)=6/36=0.167
Probability=0.16
 c)Sum is divisible by 2 and 3
=(1,5)(2,4)(3,3)(4,2)(5,1)(6,6)=6/36=0.167
Probability=0.167
